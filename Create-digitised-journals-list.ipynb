    "# Create a list of Trove's digitised periodicals\n",
    "\n",
    "Everyone know's about Trove's newspapers, but there is also a growing collection of digitised periodicals available in the 'Magazines & newsletters' category. They're not easy to find, however, which is why I created the [Trove Titles](https://trove-titles.herokuapp.com/) web app.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses the Trove API to harvest metadata relating to digitised periodicals – or more accurately, periodicals that are freely available online in a digital form. This includes some born digital publications that are available to view in formats like PDF and MOBI, but excludes some digital journals that have access restrictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The search strategy to find digitised (and digital) periodicals takes advantage of the fact that Trove's digitised resources (excluding the newspapers) all have an identifier that includes the string `nla.obj`. So we start by searching in the journals zone for records that include `nla.obj` and have the `format` 'Periodical'. By specifying 'Periodical' we exclude individual articles from digitised journals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then it's just a matter of looping through all the results and checking to see if a record includes a `fulltext` link to a digital copy. If it does it gets saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see the results in [this CSV file](digital-journals.csv). Obviously you could extract additional metadata from each record if you wanted to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default fields are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `title` – the title of the periodical\n",
    "* `contributor` – information about creator or publisher\n",
    "* `issued` – publication date, or date range\n",
    "* `format` – the type of publication, all entries should include 'Periodical', but may include other types such as 'Government publication'\n",
    "* `trove_id` – the 'nla.obj' part of the fulltext_url, a unique identifier for the digital periodical\n",
    "* `trove_url` – url of the periodical's metadata record in Trove\n",
    "* `fulltext_url` – the url of the landing page of the digital version of the periodical\n",
    "* `fulltext_url_type` – the type of digital periodical, one of 'digitised', 'edeposit', or 'other'\n",
    "\n",
    "I've used this list to [harvest all the OCRd text from digitised periodicals](Download-text-for-all-digitised-journals.ipynb)."
