    "# Get OCRd text from a digitised journal in Trove\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the digitised periodicals available in Trove make OCRd text available for download. This notebook helps you download all the OCRd text from a single periodical – ­one text file for each issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- get a list of the issues available from a digitised periodical\n",
    "- download the text of each issue\n",
    "\n",
    "Version 3 of the Trove API introduced the `/magazine/title` endpoint to retrieve information about a digitised periodical. Using this, it's possible to get a list of issues for any digitised periodical. However, the endpoint is currently buggy and I've found a number of cases where the list of issues is not complete. To avoid extra checking and work arounds, I'm not currently using the API to generate the list of issues. Instead, I'm using my earlier method that calls an internal API to deliver the HTML content of the 'Browse' panel. This browse panel includes links to all the issues of the journal. The API that populates it takes a `startIdx` parameter and returns a maximum of 20 issues. Using this you can work your way through the complete list of issues, scraping the basic metadata from the HTML, including the identifier, title, and number of pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "While you can download the complete text of an issue using the web interface, there's no option to do this with the API alone. The workaround is to mimic the web interface by constructing a download link using the issue identifier and number of pages."
