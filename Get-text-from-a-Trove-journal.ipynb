    "# Get OCRd text from a digitised journal in Trove\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the digitised journals available in Trove make OCRd text available for download â€“ one text file for each journal issue. However, while there are records for journals and articles in Trove (and available through the API), there are no records for issues. So how do we find them?\n",
    "\n",
    "After a bit of poking around I noticed that the landing page for a journal calls an internal API to deliver the HTML content of the 'Browse' panel. This browse panel includes links to all the issues of the journal. The API that populates it takes a `startIdx` parameter and returns a maximum of 20 issues. Using this you can work your way through the complete list of issues, scraping the basic metadata from the HTML, including the identifier, title, and number of pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have a list of issues we can use the issue identifiers and page numbers to construct urls to download all the OCRd text files.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my first attempt at this, I [harvested metadata and OCRd text from *The Bulletin*](Harvesting-data-from-the-Bulletin.ipynb). In that notebook I included some additional steps to parse the issue metadata, extracting dates and issue numbers. That works fine for *The Bulletin*, but there's a lot of variation in the way issue details are expressed. To make it possible to use this notebook with any journal, I've just saved the details as a string. Depending on the journal and what you want to do with the data, you might want to parse this string to extract more useful metadata."
