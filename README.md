# trove-journals

CURRENT VERSION: v2.2.0

There are hundreds of digitised periodicals in Trove (not including newspapers). Information about them is spread across a number of categories, and it's not always easy to find what's available. The notebooks in this repository help you harvest metadata, text, and images from digitised periodicals in Trove. There are also a number of pre-harvested datasets.

For more information and documentation see the [Trove periodicals](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals) section of the [GLAM Workbench](https://glam-workbench.net).
