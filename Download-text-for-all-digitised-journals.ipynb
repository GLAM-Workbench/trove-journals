    "Many of the digitised periodicals available in Trove make OCRd text available for download. This notebook helps you download all the OCRd text from all (or most of?) Trove's digitised periodicals, creating Â­one text file for each issue. It also saves a CSV-formatted list of the issues in each periodical. If you want to harvest all the text of a *single* periodical, see [Get OCRd text from a digitised journal in Trove](Get-text-from-a-Trove-journal.ipynb).\n",
