    "# Download the OCRd text for ALL the digitised periodicals in Trove!\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding which periodical issues in Trove have OCRd text you can download is not as easy as it should be. The `fullTextInd` index doesn't seem to distinguish between digitised works (with OCR) and born-digital publications (like PDFs) without downloadable text. You can use `has:correctabletext` to find articles with OCR, but you can't get a full list of the periodicals the articles come from using the `title` facet. As [this notebook explains](Create-digitised-journals-list.ipynb), you can search for `nla.obj`, but this returns both digitised works and publications supplied through edeposit. In previous harvests of OCRd text I processed all of the titles returned by the `nla.obj` search, finding out whether there was any OCRd text by just requesting it and seeing what came back. But the number of non-digitised works on the list of periodicals in digital form has skyrocketed through the edeposit scheme and this approach is no longer practical. It just means you waste a lot of time asking for things that don't exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the latest harvest I took a different approach. I only processed periodicals in digital form that *weren't* identified as coming through edeposit. These are the publications with a `fulltext_url_type` value of either 'digitised' or 'other' in my [dataset of digital periodicals](digital-journals-20220831.csv). Is it possible that there's some downloadable text in edeposit works that's now missing from the harvest? Yep, but I think this is a much more sensible, straightforward, and reproduceable approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's not the only problem. As I noted when creating the list of periodicals in digital form, there are duplicates in the list, so they have to be removed. You then have to find information obout the issues available for each title. This is not provided by the Trove API, but there is an internal API used in the web interface that you can access – see [this notebook for details](Get-text-from-a-Trove-journal.ipynb). I also noticed that sometimes where there's a single issue of a title, it's presented as if each page is an issue. I think I've found a work around for that as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "All these doubts, inconsistencies and workarounds mean that I'm fairly certain I don't have *everything*. But I do think I have *most* of the OCRd text available from digitised periodicals, and I do have a methodology, documented in this notebook, that at least provides a starting point for further investigation. As I noted in my comments on the plan for a Trove Researcher Platform, it would be great if more metadata for digitised works, other than newspapers, was made available through the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "So this notebook puts together the [list of periodicals](digital-journals-20220831.csv) [created by this notebook](Create-digitised-journals-list.ipynb) with the [code in this notebook](Get-text-from-a-Trove-journal.ipynb), and downloads as much OCRd text from digitised periodicals in the `journals` zone as it can find. If you're going to try this, you'll need a lots of patience and lots of disk space. Needless to say, don't try this on a cloud service like Binder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately you don't have to do it yourself, as I've already run the harvest and made all the text files available. See below for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "I repeat, **you probably don't want to do this yourself**. The point of this notebook is really to document the methodology used to create the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you really, really do want to do it yourself, you should first [generate an updated list of digitised periodicals](Create-digitised-journals-list.ipynb)."

    "Note that, the previous harvest excluded periodicals with the format 'government publication', this time I've kept them in, even though there's overlap with the 'Book' zone. I'm planning a new database to bring together the book and periodical harvests anyway. Also the harvested collection last time included some details of periodicals without OCRd text, but they've all now been excluded. So the full collection on CloudStor *only* includes periodicals with OCRd text. This makes it more compact and manageable. Finally, I think some duplicates slipped into the last harvest – I hope I've removed them this time.\n",
