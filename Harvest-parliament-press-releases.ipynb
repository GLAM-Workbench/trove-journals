    "Trove includes more than 370,000 press releases, speeches, and interview transcripts issued by Australian federal politicians and saved by the Parliamentary Library. You can view them all in Trove by searching for [nuc:\"APAR:PR\" in the books & libraries category](http://trove.nla.gov.au/search/category/books?keyword=nuc%3A%22APAR%3APR%22).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows you how to harvest both metadata and full text from a search of the parliamentary press releases. The metadata is available from Trove, but to get the full text we have to go back to the Parliamentary Library's database, ParlInfo. The code in this notebook updates [my original GitHub repository](https://github.com/wragge/trove-parliament-pressreleases).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use the Trove API to search for specific keywords within the press releases and harvest metadata from the results. This gives us urls that we can use to get the text of the press releases from ParlInfo.\n",
    "* Use the harvested urls to retrieve the press release from ParlInfo. The text of each release is extracted from the HTML page and saved as a plain text file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes multiple press releases can be grouped together as 'works' in Trove. This is because Trove thinks that they're versions of the same thing. However, these versions are not always identical, and sometimes Trove has grouped press releases together incorrectly. To make sure that we harvest as many individual press releases as possible, the code below unpacks any versions contained within a 'work' and turns them into individual records.\n",
    "\n",
    "It looks like the earlier documents have been OCRd and the results are quite variable. If you follow the `fulltext_url` link you should be able to view a PDF version for comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also seems that some documents only have a PDF version and not any OCRd text. These documents will be ignored by the `save_texts()` function, so you might end up with fewer texts than records.\n",
    "\n",
    "The copyright statement attached to each record in Trove reads:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Copyright remains with the copyright holder. Contact the Australian Copyright Council for further information on your rights and responsibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "So depending on what you want to do with them, you might need to contact individual copyright holders for permission.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Duplicates and false positives\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted Trove sometimes groups different press releases together as a single `work`. This seems to happen when press releases share a title and creator – for example, if an MP issues a press release titled 'Anzac Day' every year, these might be grouped as a single work. As noted above, all the different versions will be harvested by default. However, because search is operating at the work level, it's entirely possible that some of the grouped versions won't actually contain the search term you're looking for. To exclude these, we need to examine the text of each version individually to see if they match.\n",
    "\n",
    "There will also be press releases that have exactly the same text content, both within and across works. For example, when a press release is issued both by a Minister and their department, or when MPs disseminate press releases issued by their party.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it easier to deal with these two issues, I've added some post-harvest processing steps to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* remove records where the text content of the press release doesn't include any of the search terms (you'll need to adjust this to meet your needs)\n",
    "* add a `hash` column that represents the text content of a press release – this can be used to identify duplicates\n"
